Choosing organic fruit and vegetables supports farming methods that prioritise soil health and reduce synthetic inputs. If you’re starting out, focus on the produce you eat most often and build from there.

**Easy ways to begin**

- Start with organic staples you buy weekly
- Ask in‑store what’s best value right now
- Mix and match organic with conventional to suit your budget

We’re always happy to help you choose what makes the most sense for you.
