![Raw Sport plant-based protein powder range](/img/posts/rawsport-protein.webp)

If you're looking for plant-based protein powder in Cardiff, Beanfreaks stocks the Raw Sport range across all three stores — Roath, Canton, and Royal Arcade. Here's why we rate them, and which one to go for.

## Why Raw Sport

The plant-based protein market has got crowded. Most of it is decent. Some of it is cheap and unmemorable. Raw Sport sit in a different category — 100% plant-based, seriously well-formulated, and Informed Sport certified, which means every batch is independently tested for substances banned in sport.

That last point matters more than it sounds. Informed Sport certification isn't marketing — it's a rigorous third-party testing programme used by professional athletes who can't afford a positive test. For everyone else, it's a reliable indicator that what's on the label is what's in the bag.

## The range

### Elite Repair Protein — the one we'd start you on

The flagship, and worth looking at in detail because it's doing a lot more than most protein powders.

The base is bio-fermented pea protein — organically grown, processed without heat or chemicals, and fermented to enhance bioavailability and how easily it mixes. At 78g of protein per 100g it's a high protein content by any standard, plant-based or otherwise.

But the ingredient list is where it gets interesting. Alongside the protein and 2:1:1 BCAAs (already included, so no need to buy them separately), you've got:

- **Digestive support** — papain (a digestive enzyme from papaya), fennel seed, ginger extract, peppermint leaf, and a 5-strain probiotic formula with prebiotics. This is why people who normally find protein powder heavy or bloating often get on much better with this one.
- **Adaptogens and superfoods** — gelatinised maca, baobab, lucuma, and frankincense. Not window dressing; these are functional ingredients at meaningful quantities.
- **Absorption** — piperine (from black pepper), which is well-established as a bioavailability enhancer for nutrients taken alongside it.
- **Electrolytes** — coconut water powder and grey sea salt for hydration support post-training.

The flavours are genuinely good: Chocolate Brownie, Lemon Cheesecake, Salted Caramel, Vanilla Cinnamon, Wild Berry, Raw Banana, and more — plus Unflavoured (no stevia) for those who'd rather add it to food without it tasting of anything.

1kg, 31 servings, Informed Sport certified. This is the one most of our customers come back for.

### Repair High Protein — the everyday option

A solid, no-fuss plant-based protein at a slightly lower price point. Available in Chocolate, Banana, Mocha, and Chocolate Salted Caramel. If you're using protein powder regularly and want something reliable without the premium, this is a smart choice.

### Mass Gainer — for those who struggle to eat enough

A 2kg plant-based mass gainer, designed for people who need a significant calorie surplus and find it difficult to get there through food alone. A less common product in the plant-based world — most mass gainers are still whey-based — which is part of why we stock it.

### Youth Performance (RSYN) — for younger athletes

A plant-based protein formulated specifically with younger athletes in mind. 1kg, Informed Sport certified. If you're buying for a teenager who's training seriously and want something clean and tested, this is the one.

## A few honest answers to common questions

**Is plant-based protein as effective as whey?**

For most people, yes. The research has moved on significantly in the last few years. A well-formulated plant-based blend — designed to provide a complete amino acid profile — performs comparably to whey for muscle recovery and growth. Raw Sport's range is formulated with this in mind.

**I've tried plant-based protein before and found it bloating — is this different?**

Probably yes. Most plant-based proteins use straight pea isolate, and the anti-nutrients present in unfermented pea can cause bloating and digestive discomfort in some people. The Elite Repair ferments the pea protein first, which breaks those down — and then adds digestive enzymes, probiotics, prebiotics, ginger, fennel, and peppermint on top. That's a very different proposition to a standard bag of pea protein.

**How much protein do I actually need?**

A rough guide: 1.6–2.2g per kg of bodyweight per day if you're training regularly. Most people don't hit this through food alone, which is where protein powder earns its place in the cupboard.
