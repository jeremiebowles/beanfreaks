A trail mix is one of the easiest ways to make a nutrient‑dense snack. This version leans on a mix of nuts, seeds, and dried fruit to keep it balanced and satisfying.

**Try a simple mix**

- Almonds or cashews for crunch
- Pumpkin and sunflower seeds
- Dried berries or apricots
- A little dark chocolate or cacao nibs

Mix to taste and keep a jar on hand for a quick pick‑me‑up.
