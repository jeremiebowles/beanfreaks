In 1978, Kevin opened a health food shop on Victoria Bridge in Penarth. He lived above it. That's where Beanfreaks started — not with a brand strategy or a market opportunity, but with a person who cared about food and wanted to sell it to people who did too.

Nearly fifty years later, Beanfreaks is still independent, still in South Wales, and still run on the same principle: stock good things, know what you're selling, and be genuinely helpful to the person standing in front of you.

A lot has changed in between.

## The 1980s: expansion, celebrities, and a dog called Schnorbitz

By the mid-1980s, Beanfreaks had outgrown Penarth. A second store opened on St Mary Street in Cardiff city centre — and the grand opening was something. Bernie Winters cut the ribbon. If you're of a certain age you'll remember Bernie Winters; if you're not, he was one of half of a double act and brought his St Bernard, Schnorbitz, everywhere he went. Schnorbitz came to the opening. There are photos.

The St Mary Street store put Beanfreaks in the heart of the city at a time when St Mary Street still had traffic on it — the pedestrianisation didn't come until the 1990s, and the archive photos show cars parked outside where you'd now walk.

## Newport and the Happy Carrot Bistro

Around 1990, a Beanfreaks opened on Upper Dock Street in Newport — and this one had a café downstairs called The Happy Carrot Bistro. It's the branch people who grew up in Newport sometimes mention, usually with a specific dish they remember. The Newport store thrived through the early 90s, a period when health food was becoming less niche and more neighbourhood.

## 1992: protein and creatine, before anyone called it sports nutrition

Here's something that doesn't get said often enough: Beanfreaks was selling protein and creatine in 1992. The photos from that year show natural bodybuilders in the store — the baggy shorts, the posing, the era — and the products they were buying were the same category that would later become a multi-billion pound industry.

The mainstream supplement market likes to present itself as a modern invention. It isn't. Independent health food shops were there first, stocking it for the serious few before the big brands arrived and marketed it at everyone else. Beanfreaks was one of them.

## 1995: Gladiators comes to Cardiff

By 1995, Beanfreaks was established enough that Kim Betts — Lightning from the original Gladiators TV series — came to Cardiff for a signing. If you were a child in the mid-90s, Gladiators was a very big deal. Lightning was one of the most recognisable faces on British television. That she came to a health food shop in Cardiff says something about where the shop sat in the city's consciousness.

## What's gone, what's stayed

The Penarth shop is gone. So is St Mary Street, and Newport. The estate agents and coffee chains that replaced independent retailers on those streets did what they did everywhere.

What stayed is the three Cardiff stores: Roath on Albany Road, Canton on Cowbridge Road East, and Royal Arcade in the Morgan Quarter. Three different neighbourhoods, three different kinds of customers — but the same shelves, the same approach, the same staff who actually know what they're talking about when you ask about a supplement.

The product range has changed enormously, obviously. In 1978 the health food world was largely pulses, grains, and a few vitamins. Today the shelves carry bio-fermented protein powders, adaptogen blends, a full organic grocery range, and everything in between. But the principle of curation — stocking things because they're genuinely good, not because they're cheap to source or easy to shift — hasn't moved.

## Nearly fifty years is a long time

Most independent retailers don't make it. The ones that do tend to have something the chains can't replicate: actual knowledge, a point of view, and people who've been there long enough to know what works and what doesn't.

Beanfreaks has been there long enough that customers bring their children in, and sometimes their grandchildren. Long enough that the staff can tell you what sold in the 90s and what replaced it, and why. Long enough that "since 1978" isn't just a line on the logo — it's a genuine claim that means something.

Still local. Still helpful. Still Beanfreaks.
