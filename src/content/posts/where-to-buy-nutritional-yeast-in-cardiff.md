![Marigold Engevita nutritional yeast range](/img/posts/engevita-range.webp)

If you're looking for nutritional yeast in Cardiff, the short answer is: Beanfreaks. We stock the full Marigold Engevita range across all three stores — Roath, Canton, and Royal Arcade.

But if you want the longer answer — which one to buy and why — read on.

## Engevita is to nutritional yeast what Bragg's is to apple cider vinegar

There are a handful of products where one brand just becomes the thing itself. Dr Bronner's for castile soap. Bragg's for apple cider vinegar. Engevita for nutritional yeast.

Marigold has been making Engevita in the UK since the 1980s, and it's the benchmark everything else gets compared against. A tub sells every thirty seconds in the UK. When people say "nooch", they usually mean Engevita.

We stock the full range. Here's what each one is for.

## The Marigold Engevita range

### Engevita B12 Yeast Flakes — the one most people start with

The original and most popular. Fortified with a full complement of B vitamins including B12, which makes it particularly useful if you're vegan or plant-based and want a reliable dietary source of B12 that isn't a supplement capsule.

High in protein and fibre, with that savoury, slightly cheesy flavour that makes it so useful in the kitchen. Available in 100g and 650g — the 650g is the one to buy if you use it regularly.

Nourish Vegan Award 2023 Gold Winner. Great Taste 2024 Winner.

### Engevita Vitamin D & B12 Yeast Flakes — the winter one

Same B12 fortification as the original, but with added Vitamin D — produced naturally by exposing the yeast to UV light during production, the same way we make Vitamin D in our own skin.

If you're in Cardiff in January and haven't seen the sun in three weeks, this is the one. Available in 100g.

### Engevita Protein & Fibre Yeast Flakes — the unfortified option

If you're already getting B12 from elsewhere and just want nutritional yeast for the flavour, protein, and complete amino acid profile, this is the one to reach for. Unfortified — nothing added, just the yeast itself, which naturally contains all nine essential amino acids. Available in 100g.

### Organic Engevita Yeast Flakes — the one for the organic shelf

Certified organic, grown on organic beet molasses. For customers who shop organic across the board, this is the obvious choice — same flavour and protein content, certified supply chain throughout. Available in 100g and 650g.

## Which one should you choose?

**Start with the B12 Flakes** if you're new to nutritional yeast. It's the most versatile, the most popular, and the B12 fortification is genuinely useful.

**Go for Vitamin D & B12** if you want to double up on the nutrients most commonly lacking in a Welsh winter — a good call from about October through March.

**Choose Protein & Fibre** if you're already supplementing B12 separately and just want the flavour and protein without the extras.

**Pick Organic** if you shop organic across the board.

Not sure? Come in and ask. That's what we're here for.

## What do you actually do with it?

- **Pasta** — stir into sauces or sprinkle on top like parmesan
- **Toast** — on avocado, hummus, or just butter
- **Scrambled eggs or tofu scramble** — adds a savoury depth that's hard to explain until you try it
- **Soups and stews** — a tablespoon stirred in at the end rounds out the flavour
- **Popcorn** — shake over with olive oil and salt. Genuinely brilliant.

It doesn't taste exactly like cheese, but it has the same umami quality that makes savoury food taste more savoury. Once it's in your cupboard you'll find uses for it constantly.
