Organic September is a month‑long campaign that celebrates organic food, farming, and the people behind it. At Beanfreaks, it’s a chance to spotlight certified organic groceries, promote better soil and biodiversity, and share easy ways to make small organic swaps in everyday meals.

**Why it matters**

- Organic standards reduce the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilisers.
- Better soil health supports long‑term farming resilience.
- Small changes — like organic staples — can add up.

Pop in during September for organic highlights and staff picks.
